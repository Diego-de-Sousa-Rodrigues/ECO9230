% We can use this method if we wish to find the the optimal of a function
% defined from R to R

% Take the first order Taylor approximation around a point x0. Then we have
% f(x) = f(x0) + f´(x0)*(x-x0)
% Now find the value of x1 that solves the function, then we have the
% following rule: x1 = x0 - f(x0)/f'(x0)
% Repeat the procedure until the point when x(s+1) = x(s) - f(xs)/f'(xs)
% The solution is found x* if f(xs+) becomes the closest as possible to
% zero
