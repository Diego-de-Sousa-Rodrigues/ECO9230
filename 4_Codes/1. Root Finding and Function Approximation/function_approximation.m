% Function approximation are of the two types

% Local approximations: focus on one point of interest (typically
% the deterministic steady state of an economy) and approximate
% locally around that point

% Global approximations: approximate an unknown function f
% with ‘nice’ functions g that are close to f , where ‘close’ is in
% some well specified sense.
